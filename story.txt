It's the year 2055, and Apple just came out with their iPhone 47. In addition to that, they released a perfectly symmetrical cube, called the "Silver Computing Machine". They didn't mention any of its functionality, and the price started at $34,999 (with a separately sold stand for $4,999). Moe knew he had to have it, so he woke up bright and early at 6:00 AM to place his order.

As he went on the website, he noticed it had been taken over by hackers! They were stealing peoples' credit card information
to steal these cubes. He knew he had to stop it. He immediately picked up the phone and tried calling the police, but his
phone line was dead. The hackers had shut down the entire phone network!
